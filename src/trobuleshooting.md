## Using Nana-Remix on Heroku

### My user bot got suspended for some reason. Help!

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Investigation in progress.** We know this stressed you, but we'll look over it.
{% endhint %}

Currently, we don't know yet why it happening. We advise you to contact Heroku Support and ask them why. If you have your own fork of Nana-Remix, make it public \(if not\) and ask them to review the source code.
